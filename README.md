# GetElex

## Downloading, cleaning, and standardizing SBE Election Results
The goal of this project is to download, standardize, and uploade election results with minimal need to retool code with each new election. After uploading, it'd be useful to have an API to grab election results. The Tech Team can discuss endpoints and how the API may interact with other apps/scripts. 

## Tools
Built using Python, PostgreSQL, and the NCSBE S3 "FTP" server
